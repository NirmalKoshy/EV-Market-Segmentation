# Project Overview
In this project, I have jointly worked with a team to analyze the Electric Vehicle market in India using segmentation analysis. We focused on identifying the most promising customer segments, such as urban commuters, fleet operators, and environmentally conscious consumers. By examining factors like income levels, infrastructure readiness, and government incentives, we aimed to develop a feasible market entry strategy. Our goal was to recommend specific vehicle categories, such as two-wheelers, three-wheelers, or commercial vehicles, that would align with the preferences and needs of these key segments, ensuring a successful and sustainable entry into the Indian EV market.
